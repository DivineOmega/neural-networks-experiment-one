# Neural Networks Experiment One

This repository is my first experimentation using neural networks evolved via a genetic algorithm.

It consists of a simulation of creatures that must obtain food to increase their ever decreasing supply of energy. If a creature's energy hits zero, it dies and it replaced by a new creature. This new creature is created by breeding and mutating two living creatures. Parents are selected at random, with a greater chance of creatures with higher energy being selected (known as [roulette wheel selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_proportionate_selection)).
